                            <p>Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than five or six sentences.
                             But a good paragraph should not be measured in characters, words, or sentences.</p>
                             <h1></h1>
                            <p>In antiquity, a paragraph often was a single thoughtâ€”and often a single sentence, usually a very long one. Writers today, however, tend not to go on the way classical authors did.
                             In academic writing, most paragraphs include at least three sentences, though rarely more than ten.</p>

                            <p class="blue-bg text-light">1 paragraph is 100 to 200 words for essays, 50 to 100 words for easy writing. 2 paragraphs is 200 to 400 words for essays, 100 to 200 words for easy writing.
                             3 paragraphs is 300 to 600 words for essays, 150 to 300 words for easy writing.4 paragraphs is 400 to 800 words for essays, 200 to 400 words for easy writing.</p>
                            <p class="blue-bg orange-bg ">Five sentences is usually the maximum guideline for a good paragraph and includes an introductory sentence (or the main idea of a paragraph), one to three supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence</p>
